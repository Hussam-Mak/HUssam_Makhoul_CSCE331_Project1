      <p class="about-text">
        Hello. My name is Hussam Makhoul. I study computer science at Texas A&amp;M University. I focus on technology, problem solving, and steady learning. I enjoy testing new ideas, working with teams, and building projects that make a measurable impact. I look for environments where I can contribute with clear results and learn from practical challenges.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I worked as a Data Science Intern at Lockheed Martin. I built data pipelines, automated workflows, and analyzed large datasets. My work cut manual effort and improved efficiency across the team. I supported data driven decision making by delivering scripts and reports that replaced manual reviews. For example, I created automation that processed recurring data tasks in minutes rather than hours. This experience gave me direct exposure to industry scale problems and taught me how to build reliable tools that others can depend on.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I also completed the SEO Tech Developer fellowship. This program is selective and trains students for careers in software engineering. I worked with full stack tools, practiced pair programming, and built web applications that connected frontend and backend systems. I collaborated with peers from different universities and backgrounds. This gave me practice in writing clean code, reviewing work with partners, and delivering on strict deadlines. The fellowship helped me sharpen technical and communication skills at the same time.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        I work best with clear goals and strong collaboration. I use data to guide decisions and apply software engineering practices to keep projects organized. I focus on automation because it reduces waste and allows teams to scale faster. I want to keep growing in data science and software engineering. My goal is to take on projects that require technical skill, consistent execution, and measurable results. I plan to apply what I have learned in both corporate and training settings to deliver tools that provide lasting value.
