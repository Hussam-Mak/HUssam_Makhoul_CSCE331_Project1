  <h1>AI in Enterprise Compliance and Safety</h1>

  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing how enterprises manage regulatory compliance, safety protocols, and risk mitigation. With the increasing complexity of laws and global regulations — from GDPR to SOC 2 to internal audit controls — AI offers scalable, real-time solutions that traditional methods struggle to match.
  </p>

  <h2>Applications of AI in Compliance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Risk Monitoring:</strong> AI models can flag anomalous behavior in employee communications or system logs, preventing data leaks or policy violations.</li>
    <li><strong>Document & Policy Review:</strong> NLP models can automatically review contracts, flag missing clauses, and ensure documents adhere to regulatory standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Audit Automation:</strong> AI tools assist in preparing audit trails, surfacing high-risk transactions, and reducing the manual overhead of compliance reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical AI Systems:</strong> Meta-compliance models monitor other AI systems for bias, safety, or misalignment — ensuring the responsible use of AI in sensitive applications.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Interest in This Space</h2>
  <p>
    As an undergraduate researcher and intern, I’ve seen firsthand the gap between legacy enterprise workflows and the transformative potential of AI. Through projects like <strong>RegulaAI</strong> (an AI compliance copilot) and enterprise dashboarding at <strong>Lockheed Martin</strong>, I’ve developed a passion for building intelligent systems that not only detect risks but prevent them.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that scalable, explainable AI can reduce human error, boost transparency, and protect both companies and customers from harm.
