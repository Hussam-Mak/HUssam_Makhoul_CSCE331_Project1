  <h2>Aggie AI Society – Officer</h2>

  <p>
    As an officer in the Aggie AI Society at Texas A&M University, I contribute to building a strong, inclusive community for students interested in artificial intelligence.
  </p>

  <p>
    My responsibilities include mentoring new members, organizing speaker events, coordinating technical workshops, and connecting students with research and internship opportunities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this role, I aim to make AI more accessible to students from all backgrounds and help shape a collaborative, forward-thinking tech culture on campus.
  </p>

  <h2>Big Event – Community Service</h2>

  <p>
    I also participated in <strong>The Big Event</strong>, Texas A&M’s largest one-day, student-run service project. Alongside thousands of fellow Aggies, I volunteered my time to give back to the Bryan–College Station community.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our group worked on yard clean-ups, home repairs, and other service tasks for local residents. This experience strengthened my appreciation for community service and reinforced the importance of using my skills and energy to help others.
